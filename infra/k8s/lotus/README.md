EFS setup
=========

See: https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/aws/efs

Modify the EFS settings in manifest.yaml for the EFS share that you create.

Setting up EFS is very much a manual process. Step-by-step documentation would
include:

* Security group settings
* IAM permissions
