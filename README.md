Testground is a platform for testing, benchmarking, and simulating distributed and p2p
systems at scale. It's designed to be multi-lingual and runtime-agnostic, scaling gracefully
from 2 to 10k instances, only when needed.

## How does it work?

1. **You develop distributed test plans as if you were writing unit tests against local APIs.**
    - No need to package and ship the system or component under test as a separate daemon.
    - No need to expose every internal setting over an external API, just for the sake of testing.
    
2. **Your test plan calls out to the coordination API to:**
    - communicate out-of-band information (such as endpoint addresses, peer ids, etc.)
    - leverage synchronization and ordering primitives such as signals and barriers to model a
       distributed state machine.
    - programmatically apply network traffic shaping policies, which you can alter during the
       execution of a test to simulate various network conditions.
       
3. **There is no special "conductor" node telling instances what to do when.** The choreography and
   sequencing emerges from within the test plan itself.
   
4. **You decide what versions of the upstream software you want to exercise your test against.**
     - Benchmark, simulate, experiment, run attacks, etc. against versions v1.1 and v1.2 of the
       components under test in order to compare results, or test compatibility.
     - Assemble hybrid test runs mixing various versions of the dependency graph.
     
5. **Inside your test plan:**
     - You record observations, metrics, success/failure statuses.
     - You emit structured or unstructured assets you want collected, such as event logs,
       dumps, snapshots, binary files, etc.
        
6. **Via a TOML-based _composition_ file, you instruct Testground to:**
     - Assemble a test run comprising groups of 2, 200, or 10000 instances, each with different
       test parameters, or built against different depencency sets.
     - Schedule them for run locally (executable or Docker), or in a cluster (Kubernetes).
     
7. **You collect the outputs of the test plan with a single command,** and use data processing scripts and
   platforms (such as the upcoming Jupyter notebooks integration) to draw conclusions.

## Features

### Supports (or aims to support) a variety of testing workflows 💡

> (🌕 = fully supported // 🌑 = planned)

  * Experimental/iterative development 🌖 (The team at Protocol Labs has used Testground extensively to evaluate
    protocol changes in large networks, simulate attacks, measure algorithmic improvements across network boundaries,
    etc.) 
  * Debugging 🌗
  * Comparative testing 🌖
  * Backwards/forward-compatibility testing 🌖 
  * Interoperability testing 🌑
  * Continuous integration 🌑
  * Stakeholder/acceptance testing 🌑

### Simple, normalized, formal runtime environment for tests 📄

A test plan is a blackbox with a formal contract. Testground promises to inject a set of env variables, and the test
plan promises to emit events on stdout, and assets on the output directory.
  * As such, a test plan can be any kind of program, written in Go, JavaScript, C, or shell.
  * At present, we offer builders for Go, with TypeScript (node and browser) being in the works.  

### Modular builders and runners 🛠

For running test plans written in different languages, targeted for different runtimes, and levels of scale:
  * `exec:go` and `docker:go` builders: compile test plans written in Go into executables or containers.
  * `local:exec`, `local:docker`, `cluster:k8s` runners: run executables or containers locally
    (suitable for 2-300 instances), or in a Kubernetes cloud environment (300-10k instances).

### Distributed coordination API 👯‍♀️

Redis-backed lightweight API offering synchronisation primitives to coordinate and choreograph distributed test
workloads across a fleet of nodes.

### Network traffic shaping ☎️

Test instances are able to set connectedness, latency, jitter, bandwidth, duplication, packet corruption, etc. to
simulate a variety of network conditions.

### Quickstart k8s cluster setup on AWS ☁️

Create a k8s cluster ready to run Testground jobs on AWS by following the instructions at
[`testground/infra`](https://github.com/testground/infra).

### Upstream dependency selection 🧩

Compiling test plans against specific versions of upstream dependencies (e.g. moduleX v0.3, or commit 1a2b3c).

### Dealing with upstream API changes 🌱

So that a single test plan can work with a range of versions of the components under test, as these evolve over time.

### Metrics and diagnostics 📈

Automatic pprof and metrics exposition and push to ~Prometheus~ (being replaced by InfluxDB).

### Declarative jobs, we call them _compositions_ 🧵

Create tailored test runs by composing scenarios declaratively, with different groups, cohorts, upstream deps, test
params, etc. 

### Emit and collect test outputs 💾

Emit and collect/export/download test outputs (logs, assets, event trails, run events, etc.) from all participants
in a run. 

## Getting started

Currently, we don't distribute binaries, so you will have to build from source.

***Prerequisites: Go 1.14+, Docker daemon running.***

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/testground/platform.git
$ cd platform
$ make install       # builds testground and the Docker image, used by the local:docker runner.
$ testground daemon  # will start the daemon listening on localhost:8042 by default.
$ ###### WIP, clone a test plan into $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans, and run it locally. ###### 
``` 

**`$TESTGROUND_HOME` is an important directory.** If not explicitly set, testground uses `$HOME/testground` as a default.

The layout of **`$TESTGROUND_HOME`** is as follows:

```
$TESTGROUND_HOME
|
|__ plans              >>> [c] contains test plans, can be git checkouts, symlinks to local dirs, or the source itself
|    |__ suite-a       >>> test plans can be grouped in suites (which in turn can be nested); this enables you to host many test plans in a single repo / directory.
|    |    |__ plan-1   >>> source of a test plan identified by suite-a/plan-1 (relative to $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans) 
|    |    |__ plan-2
|    |__ plan-3        >>> source of a test plan identified by plan-3 (relative to $TESTGROUND_HOME/plans)
|
|__ sdks               >>> [c] hosts the test development SDKs that the client knows about, so they can be used with the --link-sdk option.
|__  |__ sdk-go
|
|__ data               >>> [d] data directory  
     |__ outputs
     |__ work

[c] = used client-side // [d] = used mostly daemon-side.
```
