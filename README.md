## What is Testground

Testground's goal is to provide a set of tools for testing next generation P2P applications (i.e. Filecoin, IPFS, libp2p & others).

## Background

You may have noticed a few test efforts with similar names underway! Testing at scale is a hard problem. We are indeed exploring and experimenting a lot, until we land on an end-to-end solution that works for us.

- Interplanetary Testbed (IPTB): https://github.com/ipfs/iptb
  - a simple utility to manage local clusters/aggregates of IPFS instances.
- libp2p testlab: https://github.com/libp2p/testlab
  - a Nomad deployer for libp2p nodes with a DSL for test scenarios.
- And others such as https://github.com/ipfs/interop and https://github.com/ipfs/benchmarks

Testground aims to leverage the learnings and tooling resulting from those efforts to provide a scalable runtime environment for the execution of various types of tests and benchmarks, written in different languages, by different teams, targeting a specific commit of IPFS and/or libp2p, and quantifying its characteristics in terms of performance, resource and network utilisation, stability, interoperability, etc., when compared to other commits.

Testground aims to be tightly integrated with the software engineering practices and tooling IPFS and libp2p teams rely on.
